# Train Scheduler

Train Scheduler using a Firebase database
created by Jennifer Gaumnitz

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station, relative to the current time.

WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL

  The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides continuing to work with jQuery and JavaScript and writing items dynamically to the DOM, the assignment also taught me how to work with Firebase and Moment.js.

HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED WITH THE PROJECT

In the bottom form, enter a train name, destination, first time of arrival (in 24-hour format with a colon), and frequency of run for your train. Click the "Add Train" button.

WHO MAINTAINS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROJECT

  Only I do, and I probably won't update it again after completing this assignment.
